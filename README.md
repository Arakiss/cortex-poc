# Cortex POC

A proof of concept to validate the viability of security log analysis using LLMs within the RODELA platform.

## Overview

This POC aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using GPT OpenAI models to analyze security logs and generate actionable intelligence. The focus is on processing historical log data and generating structured analysis that can be consumed by downstream systems.

## Development Framework & Scaffolding

### CoreSight Framework
The project utilizes CoreSight, a lightweight and transparent micro-framework for orchestrating LLM-based agents. CoreSight was chosen for its:
- Direct developer control
- Minimal complexity
- Transparent operation
- Efficient agent orchestration

CoreSight was created by Petru Arakiss (petruarakiss@gmail.com) and is used under private license for this project.

### Development Abstractions
In addition to CoreSight, this POC leverages several personal abstractions and utilities developed by Petru Arakiss. These components serve as development scaffolding to:
- Accelerate initial development and prototyping
- Provide temporary structuring patterns
- Enable rapid iteration and testing
- Facilitate proof of concept validation

These additional abstractions are used purely for development purposes and are not intended to be part of the final production implementation. They serve as a temporary framework to validate concepts and patterns that will be properly implemented in the final version.

## Dataset Specifications

### Test Dataset
- Total events: 400 events
- Event types distribution:
  - SQL injections (15.50%)
  - Port scans (14.75%)

  - Brute force attempts (13.25%)
  - Geographic pattern anomalies (12.25%)
- Multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, FILE)
- Various severity levels (1-5)

### Batch Processing

- Output Formatter: Structures analysis results

### Agent Architecture
- Orchestration Agent: Manages workflow and task distribution
- Analysis Agents: Specialized in different attack patterns
- Synthesis Agent: Combines findings and generates recommendations
- Validation Agent: Ensures output quality and consistency

### Data Flow
1. Input: JSONL security logs (400 events)
2. Processing: Event grouping and context building
3. Analysis: CoreSight-managed LLM-based pattern detection
4. Output: Structured JSON intelligence

- Actionable recommendations for identified threats
- Structured, parseable JSON output
- Processing cost under budget constraints
- Efficient agent orchestration via CoreSight

### Performance Targets
- Batch size: 50-100 events/request
- Response time: <30s per batch
- Cost efficiency: <$0.02 per event
- Total processing time: <5 minutes for full dataset
- Agent orchestration overhead: <5% of total processing time
